#XOSPApps

  - What are those?
  From Release 2 Revision 2 XOSP will be build in a different kind of way. In order to allow the Maintainer to choose what apps to include in their builds i decided to create a separate zip package which it will be flashed right after the ROM compilation process.
 - How to build them?
 You don't need to do anything, the build environment will do that for you right after you start the compilation process for your device and it will automatically create a flashable zip to the out folder of your target device. 

##NOTES

  - These Apps are ment to be flashed only on XOSP ROM, so please do NOT use them on other kind of ROM 
  - If you want to use the apps for other porpouse then don't forget to write where did you picked them.
  - The Apps are universally ported for arm and x86 based Architecture so there are not tested on arm64 based architecture
